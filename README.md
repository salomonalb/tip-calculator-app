# Tip Calculator App

This calculator allows you to input the amount to be billed, the percentage to tip and the number of people to split the bill with.

It outputs the tip amount for each person and the total amount for each person.

Finally, it has a button that allows you to reset the app.

It's made with HTML, SCSS and Typescript.

The input validation was made in HTML with the pattern attribute and regular expressions.

Typescript was used to update the classes acording to validity and selection, to perform calculations and to update the output amount. 

The build tool used to compile Typescript and SCSS files is [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/).

This repository was created using the Github CLI.

This project is deployed with Netlify.
